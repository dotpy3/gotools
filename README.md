# Golang minitools

This is the repository for a webpage hosting a few Golang tools that I've made, that were useful to myself but that might very well be useful for others. You can use it directly at [this address](https://dotpy3.github.io/minigotools/).

If you share that opinion, please feel free to fork this repository and to propose your own improvements.

## Golang getter/interface generator

This is the first tool available. For a given struct, it generates all the getters for the attributes, and the interface that exposes those getters. It is useful whenever you want to abstract a struct into an interface, for example.
